# Examples

With basic use of the library under your belt, none of that is really useful without some examples showing you how to do some common tasks. Keeping in mind you can edit these examples however you need.

The best way to figure out what you probably want to do is by studying the [Twitch documentation](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/commands/) to figure out what parameters and tags you expect to see.

From there write an extension that outputs what you need.
